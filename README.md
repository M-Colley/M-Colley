<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>I am a tenure-track Lecturer/Assistant Professor in HCI at the <strong>UCL Interaction Centre</strong>.
  
  My multidisciplinary research in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Accessibility, and Computational Modeling and Simulation</strong> is dedicated to tackling complex challenges and seizing opportunities within advanced mobility technologies. It involves designing, implementing, and testing novel simulators to study futuristic mobility scenarios. My work aims to address issues such as undertrust in automated vehicles and to enhance accessibility in urban (air) mobility, thereby supporting societal and industrial growth. A significant portion of my research focuses on evaluating innovative interaction paradigms between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users, utilizing empirical evidence alongside simulation-based approaches to analyze their broad-scale impacts.</p>
